VR for Social Good: VR experience using Google Cardboard in Unity to sensitize the users about sustainable practices.

Used Unity 7.1.3 along with C# along Google cardboard. 

I planned to address the goal 15 given by United Nations. It aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Virtual reality makes the person feel the condition of another place or another person or another time, hence the user can connect better to the cause. One can create the a different scenario and the user can easily relate to it as he would be feeling it. That is why, virtual reality is potentially a better medium to convey the message.
